# FreeCodeCamp-Personalized-Book-Recommendation-System
1. **Problem Statement** 
 - *Book Recommendation System*

1. **Overview**
  - *The goal of this project is to develop a book recommendation system that suggests similar books to a given book title. The recommendation system should provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences.*

1. **Dataset**
  - *The dataset used for this project consists of book information and user ratings. Each record in the dataset contains details about a book, such as its title, author, and ISBN, as well as user ratings for the books.*

1. **Objective**
  - *The objective of this project is to implement a function get_recommends() that takes a book title as input and returns a list of recommended books based on similarity to the input book.*

1. **Approach**
  - **Data Preprocessing:** *Load and preprocess the book dataset, including handling missing values and converting categorical variables to numerical representations.*
  - **Recommendation Algorithm:** *Implement a recommendation algorithm that computes the similarity between books based on user ratings or book attributes (e.g., genre, author).*
  - **Function Implementation:** *Develop the get_recommends() function that takes a book title as input, computes similarities with other books, and returns a list of recommended books sorted by similarity.*
  - **Testing:** *Evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of the recommendation system by comparing recommended books with known similar books and user preferences.*
  - **Optimization:** *Fine-tune the recommendation algorithm and parameters to improve the quality of recommendations and enhance user satisfaction.*

1. **Success Criteria**
  - *The project will be considered successful if the implemented recommendation system provides accurate and relevant book recommendations that align with user preferences. Additionally, the system should pass predefined test cases, ensuring its functionality and correctness.*

1. **Deliverables**
  - *get_recommends() function that provides book recommendations.*
  - *Test cases to validate the functionality of the recommendation system.*
  - *Evaluation report documenting the performance and effectiveness of the recommendation algorithm.*
  - *Codebase including data preprocessing, recommendation algorithm implementation, and testing scripts.*
